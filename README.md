My name is Eric Kawaguchi and I am a postdoctoral resarch fellow with <a href="https://biostatsepi.usc.edu/" target="_blank"> USC's Biostatistics and Epidemiology division.</a> I received both my PhD and MS in biostatistics from <a href="https://biostat.ucla.edu" target="_blank">UCLA</a> and my BS in mathematics from the <a href="https://www.cpp.edu/~math" target="_blank">California State Polytechnic University, Pomona.</a>

This is my personal GitHub repository that hosts both my academic (and non academic) work!
